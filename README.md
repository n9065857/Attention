 *Title
 
  Improving robustness in X-ray image classification through attention mechanisms in convolutional neural networks
  
 *Description
 
This project implements a deep learning framework in MATLAB 2024a that integrates attention mechanisms into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of musculoskeletal radiographs (MURA dataset) and frontal-view chest X-rays. The model addresses noise, interpretability, and generalisation challenges by incorporating hierarchical feature fusion, robust feature selection (SIFT), and ensemble learning techniques (KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM).
