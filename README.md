MURA – Musculoskeletal Radiograph Dataset.
The first dataset used in this study is MURA, a large-scale collection of musculoskeletal radiographs comprising 40,561 images from 14,863 studies and 12,173 patients. Each study corresponds to one of seven standard upper extremity exams: elbow, finger, forearm, hand, humerus, shoulder, or wrist. All studies were manually labeled as either normal or abnormal by board-certified radiologists at Stanford Hospital during routine clinical interpretation between 2001 and 2012. MURA serves as a benchmark dataset for bone abnormality detection.

Chest X-ray Dataset.
The second dataset is a widely used public collection of frontal-view chest radiographs for detecting thoracic diseases. It provides labeled examples of common pathologies and is employed to evaluate the model’s performance on soft tissue imaging, complementing the bone-focused MURA dataset.
